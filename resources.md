## Books

The course is mostly self-contained, but reading a textbook will help you with your understanding.

### Required:

- [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) by Cameron Davidson-Pilon. Scroll down to the PyMC3 part in the README.


### Highly Recommended

- [Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/): A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan by Richard McElreath.
-  [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin. 3rd Edition.

We will not be using R or Stan, but the principles remain the same.

- [Wasserman's All of Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/)

- [Shalizi's Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)
