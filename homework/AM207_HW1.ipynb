    "Missing data is a very important topic in statistics and machine learning. Let us begin to explore how to handle missing data in our analysis.

Each line represents 13 (mostly chemical) predictors of the response variable wine class, including things like alcohol content, hue, and phenols.  Unfortunately some of the predictor values were lost in measurement. Please load `wine_quality_missing.csv`.  (If pandas makes your life easier, feel free to use it).\n",
