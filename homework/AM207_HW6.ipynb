    "Suppose we ask you to memorize the order of the top five movies on IMDB. When we quiz you on the order afterwards, you might not recall the correct order, but the mistakes you will tend to make in your recall can be modeled by simple probabilistic models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's say that the top five movies are:  \n",
    "1. *The Shawshank Redemption*\n",
    "2. *The Godfather*\n",
    "3. *Wonder Woman*\n",
    "4. *Black Panther*\n",
    "5. *Pulp Fiction*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's represent this ordering by the vector $\\omega = (1,2,3,4,5)$. \n",

    "If you were to mistakenly recall the top five movies as:\n",
    "2. *The Godfather*\n",

    "5. *Pulp Fiction*\n",
    "4. *Black Panther*\n",

    "\n",
    "We'd represent your answer by the vector $\\theta = (2,3,5,4,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have a way of quantifying how wrong your answer can be. We define the Hamming distance between two top five rankings, $\\theta, \\omega$, as follows:\n",
    "$$d(\\theta, \\omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\mathbb{I}_{\\theta_i\\neq \\omega_i},$$ \n",
    "where $\\mathbb{I}_{\\theta_i\\neq \\omega_i}$ is the indicator function that returns 1 if $\\theta_i\\neq \\omega_i$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Hamming distance between your answer and the correct answer is $d(\\theta, \\omega)=4$, because you only ranked *Black Panther* in both answers correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's suppose that the probability of giving a particular answer (expressed as $\\theta$) is modeled as\n",
    "$$ p(\\theta \\,|\\, \\omega, \\lambda) \\propto  e^{-\\lambda\\, d(\\theta,\\, \\omega)}.$$\n",

    "Implement an Metropolis algorithm to produce sample guesses from 500 individuals, with various $\\lambda$ values, $\\lambda=0.2, 0.5, 1.0$. What are the top five possible guesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B:\n",
    "Using the Metropolis algorithm, compute the probability that *The Shawshank Redemption* is ranked as the top movie (ranked number 1) . Compare the resulting probabilities for the various different $\\lambda$ values. Summarize your findings."

    "You are a renowned observational astronomer working on gravitational lensing and you just got news about a source whose morphology appears distorted, most likely because there is a foreground source (an ensemble of mini black holes for which you know the mass and position) acting as a lens. Your gravitational lensing calculations indicate that the detected flux $F$ from the background source as a function of right ascencion ($x$) and declination ($y$) can be described by a modified Beale's function:\n",
