    "The multilayer perceptron can be understood as a logistic regression classifier in which the input is first transformed using a learnt non-linear transformation. The non-linear transformation is usually chosen to be either the logistic function or the $\\tanh$ function or the RELU function, and its purpose is to project the data into a space where it becomes linearly separable The output of this so-called hidden layer is then passed to the logistic regression graph that we have constructed in the first problem. \n",

    "We'll construct a model with **1 hidden layer**. That is, you will have an input layer with a nonlinearity, then a hidden layer with the nonlinearity, and finally a cross-entropy (or equivalently log-softmax with a log-loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a similar architecture as in the first part and the same training, validation, and test sets, build a PyTorch model for the multilayer perceptron. Use the $\\tanh$ function as the non-linear activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use $\\lambda = 0.001$ to compare with Problem 2. Experiment with the learning rate (try 0.1 and 0.01 for example), batch size (use 20, 50, 100 and 200) and the number of units in your hidden layer (use between 25 and 100 units). For what combination of these parameters do you obtain the highest validation accuracy after a resonable number of epochs that lead to convergence ( start at 10 epochs and play around a bit for convergence)? How does your test accuracy compare to the logistic regression classifier?\n",
    "2. Try the same values of $\\lambda$ you used in Question 2. Does the test set accuracy improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint #1:* The initialization of the weights matrix for the hidden layer must assure that the units (neurons) of the perceptron operate in a regime where information gets propagated. For the $\\tanh$ function, you may find it advisable to initialize with the interval $[-\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}]$, where $fan_{in}$ is the number of units in the $(i-1)$-th layer, and $fan_{out}$ is the number of units in the i-th layer.\n",

    "*Hint #2*\n",
    "Train/Validate/Test split can be done in numpy or in PyTorch. Lab will describe a way to do it keeping within the MNIST `DataLoader` workflow: the key is to pass a `SubsetRandomSampler` to `DataLoader`: see the docs."
