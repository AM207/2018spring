Assign a value $s_i$ where $i\\in [1,\\dots,N]$ to each city that represents its size measured by population.  Let $\\forall s_i, \\  s_i \\in [1, 10)$.  If two cities are farther away from each other than a **distance threshold of 10** and both have populations greater than a **population threshold of 5** assume there is a flight connection between them.  In all other cases assume that our poor salesman would have to drive between cities. Flying is faster than driving by a factor of 10. \n",
