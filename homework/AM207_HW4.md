**Instructions:**

- Upload your final answers as well as your iPython notebook containing all work to Canvas.

- Structure your notebook and your work to maximize readability.

## Problem 1: Optimization (contd)

Suppose you are building a pricing model for laying down telecom cables over a geographical region. Your model takes as input a pair of  coordinates, $(x, y)$, and contains two parameters, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$. Given a coordinate, $(x, y)$, and model parameters, the loss in revenue corresponding to the price model at location $(x, y)$ is described by
$$
L(x, y, \lambda_1, \lambda_2) = 0.000045\lambda_2^2 y - 0.000098\lambda_1^2 x  + 0.003926\lambda_1 x\exp\left\{\left(y^2 - x^2\right)\left(\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2\right)\right\}
$$
Read the data contained in `HW3_data.csv`. This is a set of coordinates configured on the curve $y^2 - x^2 = -0.1$. Given the data, find parameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ that minimize the net loss over the entire dataset.

### Part A: Further problems with descent algorithms
Using your implementation of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, document the behaviour of your two algorithms for the following starting points, and for a number of stepsizes of your choice:
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = (-2.47865, 0)$
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = (-3, 0)$
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = (-5, 0)$
- $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = (-10, 0)$
Based on your analysis of the loss function $L$, explain what is happening to your descent algorithms.

## Problem 2: Logistic Regression and MNIST (contd)




The MNIST dataset is one of the classic datasets in Machine Learning and is often one of the first datasets against which new classification algorithms test themselves. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of which is 28x28 pixels. 

Last time you used PyTorch to build a handwritten digit multi-class logistic regression classifier that you trained and tested with MNIST dataset.

We'll introduce validation sets and regularization in this problem.

Using the softmax formulation, write a PyTorch model that computes the cost function using an L2 regularization approach (see `optim.SGD` in PyTorch or write your own cost function) and minimizes the resulting cost function using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

Construct and train your classifier using a batch size of 256 examples, a learning rate η=0.1, and a regularization factor λ=0.01.

1. Using classification accuracy, evaluate how well your model is performing on the validation set at the end of each epoch. Plot this validation accuracy as the model trains. 
2. Duplicate this plot for some other values of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. When should you stop the training for different values of λ? Give an approximate answer supported by using the plots.
3. Select what you consider the best regularization parameter and predict the labels of the test set. Compare with the given labels. What classification accuracy do you obtain on the test set?

## Problem 3: Multi-Layer Perceptron

The multilayer perceptron can be understood as a logistic regression classifier in which the input is first transformed using a learnt non-linear transformation. The non-linear transformation is usually chosen to be either the logistic function or the $\tanh$ function or the RELU function, and its purpose is to project the data into a space where it becomes linearly separable The output of this so-called hidden layer is then passed to the logistic regression graph that we have constructed in the first problem. 

![](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/_images/mlp.png)

We'll construct a model with **1 hidden layer**. That is, you will have an input layer with a nonlinearity, then a hidden layer with the nonlinearity, and finally a cross-entropy (or equivalently log-softmax with a log-loss)


Using a similar architecture as in the first part and the same training, validation, and test sets, build a PyTorch model for the multilayer perceptron. Use the $\tanh$ function as the non-linear activation function. 

1. Use $\lambda = 0.001$ to compare with Problem 2. Experiment with the learning rate (try 0.1 and 0.01 for example), batch size (use 20, 50, 100 and 200) and the number of units in your hidden layer (use between 25 and 100 units). For what combination of these parameters do you obtain the highest validation accuracy after a resonable number of epochs that lead to convergence ( start at 10 epochs and play around a bit for convergence)? How does your test accuracy compare to the logistic regression classifier?
2. Try the same values of $\lambda$ you used in Question 2. Does the test set accuracy improve?


*Hint #1:* The initialization of the weights matrix for the hidden layer must assure that the units (neurons) of the perceptron operate in a regime where information gets propagated. For the $\tanh$ function, you may find it advisable to initialize with the interval $[-\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}},\sqrt{\frac{6}{fan_{in}+fan_{out}}}]$, where $fan_{in}$ is the number of units in the $(i-1)$-th layer, and $fan_{out}$ is the number of units in the i-th layer.

*Hint #2*
Train/Validate/Test split can be done in numpy or in PyTorch. Lab will describe a way to do it keeping within the MNIST `DataLoader` workflow: the key is to pass a `SubsetRandomSampler` to `DataLoader`: see the docs.
